Both principal combatants, the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the challenger Congress, said they were on course to winning the people’s mandate to govern the nation for the next five years as the curtain dropped on Friday on a bitter and bruising campaign for the 17th general elections.
“The election has been amazing. Elections were held in a positive spirit. A government with full majority will come back after remaining in power for five years. This is probably happening after a very long time. This is a big deal in itself,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a press briefing -- his first in five years -- he attended with BJP president Amit Shah.
